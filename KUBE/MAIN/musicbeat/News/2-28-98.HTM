The forthcoming <b>Bob Marley</B> three-CD box set highlights music reflective of the strife the legendary reggae singer felt during the late '60s.
<p>
The songs chosen to appear on <I>The Complete Wailers 1967 - 1972 Part 1</I> describe through Marley's haunting lyrics the struggle and oppression he and other black people felt. However, those songs, especially one titled "Cheer Up," display Marley's ability to locate the problems -- from social unrest and civil rights violations -- and provide a source of hope for them.
<p>
In "Cheer Up" Marley sings, "Cheer up my brothers ... I know it won't be long, that train just got to come ... We been down in captivity so long, so long. If we unite then we will be free, so strong, so strong." 
<p>
The collection, which comprises three individual CDs featuring rare, early Marley tracks, also includes extensive liner notes and photographs that show a snapshot of the world and Marley's life at the time he recorded the songs. 
<P>
Look for the <I>Complete Wailers</I> to hit stores on March 17. (Ari Bendersky)

(LOS ANGELES) - For <b>Elton John</b>, receiving a knighthood from <b>Queen Elizabeth II</b> on Tuesday was the pinnacle of his 33-year career. 
<P>
"They don't come much bigger than this," Sir Elton told reporters. He was accompanied by his parents and his partner, <B>David Furnish</B>. Not everyone is familiar with the rock icon, it seems. He was announced as "Sir John Elton."

<!-- Story 3 -->
Despite telling <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> last November they never win awards, the <b>Chemical Brothers</b> took home the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance.
<p>
The London-based techno duo beat out <b>Steve Vai</B> and <b>Joe Satriani</B> to earn their place in the hallowed Grammy history books. Their song, "Block Rockin' Beats," from the gold-certified <I>Dig Your Own Hole</I> earned the duo their first Grammy.
<p>
The Brothers, <b>Ed Simons</b> and <B>Tom Rowlands</B>, talked to <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> about the comparison between their music and that of the <b>Prodigy</b>, another forerunner in the realm of electronic music. Simons said because Prodigy "dress well and look cool," they aim to sell lots of records and win awards. The Chemical Brothers, on the other hand, say although they are always in the running for awards, they generally don't win. Getting records out to the people is a prize in itself and in fact is more important to the Brothers. "We make records for people to dance to," Simons said. "Our goal was to get our music to DJs all around the world."
<p>
Now that the Chemical Brothers have won a Grammy -- the biggest prize in the music business -- they can continue spreading their innovative techno sound around the world. Last we heard, they were working on new music, but it doesn't look like they'll have anything new until 1999. (Ari Bendersky)

In order to protect her 16-month-old daughter, <b>Lourdes</b>, from the media, <B>Madonna</B> has decided to exclude footage of her child from an interview that is scheduled to air this weekend.
<P>
 The exclusive interview conducted by <i>MTV News</i> correspondent <B>Kurt Loder</B>, originally featured the pop mom's bouncing bundle dancing to the "Macarena."  Loder told the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> Wednesday that Madonna changed her mind about including the footage after she and Lourdes traveled to Paris and were confronted by thousands of screaming fans.  
<P>
As a result, 53 seconds of footage was cut from the program. Describing the scene in Paris, Loder told the <I>Times</I>, "I think she was really, really shaken."  (Lana Fanelli)

<!-- Story 3 -->
The music world is experiencing the aftermath of its own El Nino following last night's <b>40th annual Grammy Awards</B> presentation at <b>New York's Radio City Hall</b>. 
<P>
Perennial favorite <b>Jimmy Sturr</b> may have captured his eighth polka-related award, but it was <b>Bob Dylan</b> and son <B>Jakob</b> who stole the show, upstaging the Polka Prince by snagging three and two Grammys, respectively.
<P>
The elder Dylan won the hearts of rock purists by winning the Album of the Year award (<i>Time Out of Mind</i>), Best Contemporary Folk Album (<i>Time Out of Mind</i>) and Best Rock Song ("Cold Irons Bound"), while Jakob and the <b>Wallflowers</b> snagged awards for Best Rock Performance By a Duo or Group With Vocal ("One Headlight") and Best Rock Song ("One Headlight").
<P>
Before Dylan captured his final piece of hardware, he performed a memorably rugged version of the bluesy "Lovesick," unwittingly complemented by a topless man performing an interpretive dance. The limber neo-hippie (the dancer, not Bob), who had the words "Soy Bomb" painted on his chest, appeared beside the unflappable veteran and vogued to the song before half-asleep security yanked him off-stage. 
<P>
Earlier, the napping staff allowed the <b>Wu-Tang Clan's</b> daft <b>Ol' Dirty Bastard</b> to disrupt <b>Shawn Colvin's</b> acceptance speech for Song of the Year with his tangential filibuster about how the Clan should have won the Best Rap Album award instead of <b>Puff Daddy and the Family</b>. "Puff Daddy is good, but Wu Tang is for the children," ODB told the dumbfounded audience. (<b>Mayor Rudy Giuliani</b> was undoubtedly doubled over in laughter. Maybe next year <b>Jerry Springer</b>
will lend Grammy organizer <b>Michael Greene</b> some henchmen to keep things copacetic.) 
<p>
Another bizarre moment came during the award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance, in which <b>Trisha Yearwood</b> nabbed the Grammy for the song "How Do I Live" one minute after 15-year old <b>LeAnn Rimes</b> performed a stirring, also-nominated version of the same song. (That's like giving props to Thelma instead of Louise.) 
<p>
Squeezing 18 performances into three hours is no easy task -- one that inevitably involves cutting some performances short (so long as they're not ratings-grabbers <b>Celine Dion</b> or <b>R. Kelly</b>, who picked up three Grammy Awards for the <i>Space Jam</i> song "I Believe I Can Fly"). 
<P>
The <b>Lilith Fair</b> contingent got the proverbial shaft this year as <b>Paula Cole</b>, Shawn Colvin and <B>Sarah McLachlan</b> were given the "verse-chorus, next, please" treatment for their back-to-back-to-back performance. Still, Cole managed to drop a kickin' human beatbox into her truncated version of "Where Have All the Cowboys Gone." 
<P>
After Colvin's reflective take on "Sunny Came Home" (Song of the Year and Record of the Year), Cole and Colvin joined double-Grammy winner McLachlan (Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Pop Instrumental Performance) for a gorgeous "Building a Mystery." Later, Cole avoided being a shut-out for her seven nominations by upsetting favorites <b>Hanson</b> and <b>Fiona Apple</b> to capture a Grammy for Best New Artist. (To celebrate, Cole will <i>not</i> shave her armpits.) 
<P>
<p>
Unexpected winners included Ray-Ban sunglasses, which received choice product placement from <b>Will Smith</b> during his inspired rap medley "Men in Black/Gettin' Jiggy Wit It," as well as <b>Dan Aykroyd</b> and <b>John Goodman</b>, who managed to plug <i>Blues Brothers 2000</i> during a performance of "Respect" featuring <b>Aretha Franklin</B>. Smith later accepted a Grammy for Best Rap Solo Performance ("Men in Black").
<p>
Other artists who lugged Grammys to the after-parties included: <b>Erykah Badu</b> for Best R&B album (<i>Baduizm</i>) and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance ("On and On"); <b>Radiohead</b> and <b>Jamiroquai</b> -- neither of whom attended the show -- for Best Alternative Music Performance (<i>OK Computer</i>) and Best Pop Performance By a Duo or Group with Vocal ("Virtual Insanity"), respectively; the <b>Smashing Pumpkins</b> for Best Hard Rock Performance ("The End Is the Beginning Is the End"); <b>Tool</b> for Best Metal Performance (<i>Aenema</i>); <b>John Fogerty</b> for Best Rock Album (<i>Blue Moon Swamp</i>); the <b>Chemical Brothers</b> for Best Rock Instrumental Performance ("Block Rockin' Beats"); and Fiona Apple for Best Female Vocal Performance ("Criminal"). Fortunately, Apple didn't accept the award during the show's telecast. (Blair R. Fischer for <I>Rolling Stone Network</I>)
