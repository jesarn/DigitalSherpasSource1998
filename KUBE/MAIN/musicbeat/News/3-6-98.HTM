<!-- Story 3 -->
When the new <b>Dave Matthews Band</b> album hits stores, fans of the band will hear a familiar female voice: <b>Alanis Morissette</b>. 
<p>
The album, <I>Before These Crowded Streets</I>, is set for an April 28 release on <b>RCA Records</b> and will feature Morissette singing on a few songs, according to a source for Dave Matthews. Banjo slayer <b>Bela Fleck</b> also shows up on numerous tracks. 
<P>
The album was produced by <b>Steve Lillywhite</b> and was recorded in Sausalito, Calif., and New York. Our source described the sound as a definite progression from their last album, <I>Crash</I>, complete with complex layering. 
<p>
The band completed the album last week and is getting set to tour. They will play an afternoon benefit show on April 18 at <b>Victory Stadium</b> in Roanoke, Va. Tickets for the event go on sale March 21 and cost $28.50. Proceeds will benefit Virginia-based charities.
<p>
Following the benefit concert, DMB will head down to play the <b>New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival</b> on April 26 and then head off on a Canadian tour. That tour kicks off May 2 in Montreal. DMB will play seven dates in Canada and end the tour in Vancouver on May 13. For a complete tour schedule, head over to the <a href="http://www.dmband.com/tourdate.html">official Dave Matthews Band website</a>. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 3 -->
<b>Hootie & the Blowfish</b> had to halt their South Carolina writing and rehearsal sessions so guitarist <b>Mark Bryan</b> could join his wife at the hospital after she went into labor.
<p>
The multiplatinum-selling pop artists were about to begin interviewing producers to start pre-production on their third album in an old warehouse in Columbia, S.C., according to a source close to the band. However, the foursome -- Bryan, <b>Jim "Soni" Sonefeld, Darius Rucker</b> and <b>Dean Felber</b> -- had to postpone the sessions when Bryan's wife went into labor. The couple welcomed their baby girl into the world earlier this week.
<p>
A spokeswoman for the band told <B>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> that Hootie will begin recording the follow-up to <I>Fairweather Johnson</I> in about a month, once Bryan and his wife have settled into parenthood. 
<P>
In related news, Hootie & the Blowfish will headline the fourth annual <b>Monday after the Masters Pro-Am</b> show, which will benefit <b>Junior Golf</B>. The concert, which will feature Hootie and some "special friends," will be held on April 13 at the Columbia, S.C., <b>Township Auditorium</b>. When <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> asked a band spokeswoman who the friends would be,  she responded,  "It could be <b>Dan Marino</b>. It could be <b>Toad the Wet Sprocket</b>." In other words, the band won't know until they hit the stage. 
<p>
Tickets run $20.50 and are currently available. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 3 -->
<B>The Backstreet Boys</B> will hit "Saturday Night Live" on March 14.
<P>
The five member R&B-pop group consisting of <B>Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Brian Littrell, AJ McLean</B> and <B>Kevin Richardson</B> have been scoring big points since the release of their self-titled debut.  The album has gone triple platinum -- boasting sales of more than 11 million copies -- due largely in part to the group's first triple platinum single, "Quit Playing Games (With My Heart)."  It currently sits at the No. 6 spot on the <I>Billboard</I> Top 200 Album chart.
<P>
The Boys' new single, "Everybody (Backstreet's Back)" will hit radio stations on March 9.  A North American tour beginning July 8 is scheduled to kick off in Charlotte, N.C.  (Lana Fanelli)
