<!-- Story 1 -->
(NEW YORK) - The multi-CD album <I>Crystal Ball</I>, by the <b>Artist Formerly Known as Prince</b>, will also be available at <b>Blockbuster</b> and the <b>Musicland Group</b>, in addition to <b>Best Buy</b>, according to a source in the artist's camp. 
<p>
Best Buy had said that it would be the sole distributor for the album, originally sold via the artist's Web site, but cautioned that the deal would not be an exclusive since the company had agreed to make the album available to merchants in markets where it doesn't have stores. However, nothing was finalized with Best Buy, say sources.

<!-- Story 1 -->
(LOS ANGELES) - Singer <b>Toni Braxton</b> filed for Chapter 7 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles on Jan. 22, listing liabilities of more than $1 million. 
<P>
Braxton's litigation attorney <b>Stanton L. Stein</b> says the filing will bring to a halt legal proceedings in the crossover star's contract dispute with <b>Arista</b> and <b>LaFace Records</b>. In December, Braxton sued the labels, claiming her contract was invalid under a California statute limiting personal service agreements to seven years; Stein says Arista countersued Braxton later that month. An Arista spokesman could not be reached for comment.

<!-- Story 3 -->
The first set of shows for the upcoming <B>Spice Girls</b> world tour went on sale over the weekend and sold out in less than two hours.
<p>
Critics may be saying the Spice Girls time is coming due, but fans obviously don't agree. Tickets for the Feb. 24 and 25 shows, which kick off the Fab Five's European tour, went on sale shortly after being announced on live radio and were snatched up in no time. 
<p>
The show will take place at the <b>Point Theatre</B>, a converted railway warehouse along the banks of the River Liffey, where the <b>Eurovision Song Contest</B> is often held.
<P>
The world tour kicks off at the end of the month and sees the Royal Spicy Ones hitting arenas and stadiums in countries including Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway and of course, the United Kingdom. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 2 -->
Singer <b>Bobby Brown</b>, who first got his start with <b>New Edition</b> back in the '80s, was convicted in a DUI case on Thursday in a Florida courtroom.
<p>
Brown, 30, was finally brought to trial following an incident in 1996 when he crashed his black Porsche into bushes and a street sign in Hollywood, Fla. When the judge read Brown's sentence, the singer reportedly broke down and started crying. His wife, <b>Whitney Houston</b>, was said to be crying as well.
<P>
After the crash, Brown's blood alcohol level was tested at 0.2 percent, more than twice Florida's legal limit, according to legal testimony. Drugs were also discovered in his blood. Further, Brown broke four ribs and a foot in the crash, testimony showed. 
<p>
Brown was ordered to spend five days in jail and undergo drug and alcohol treatment. His attorney, <b>Robert Buonauro</b>, questioned why it took four months to charge Brown with drunk driving and, after posting a $15,000 bond to keep Brown out of jail, said he would appeal the case, according to the <I>Associated Press</I>.
