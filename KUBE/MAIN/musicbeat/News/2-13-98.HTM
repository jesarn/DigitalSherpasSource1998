<!-- Story 1 -->
Just when you thought he had finally thawed out, the Iceman cometh again. <b>Vanilla Ice</b> has just announced tour dates.
<p>
The Miami-based rapper who made it big in 1990 with the hit "Ice Ice Baby" will kick off the tour at the <b>Juke Joint</B> in Springfield, Mo, on Feb. 19. Ice will mainly hit venues in the Midwest and South, but will also venture across the border to play three gigs in Canada.
<p>
Ice, whose real name is <b>Robert Van Winkle</b>, has been fairly quiet since his major movie debut, <I>Cool As Ice</I>. However, when his album, <I>To The Extreme</I>, came out in 1990, it spawned the <b>David Bowie/Queen</b> sampled "Ice Ice Baby." The album stayed at No. 1 for 16 weeks and went on to sell more than seven million copies. Ice's star began to fade after that and his 1994 album, <I>Mind Blown</I>, did not measure up to his debut. (Ari Bendersky)

The lyrics to <B>Elton John</B> and <b>Bernie Taupin's</b> "Candle in the Wind 1997," a tribute to the late <B>Diana, Princess of Wales</B>, sold for $442,500 during an auction held by <b>Christie's Los Angeles</b> on Wednesday. 
<P>
More than 250 people gathered in Beverly Hills Wednesday night to stake their claim to the lyrics that made "Candle in the Wind 1997" the best-selling single of all time. <B>The Lund Foundation</B>, an organization that supports programs for young children, registered the highest bid and took home the coveted lyrics. All the proceeds from the auction will go to benefit Children's Hospital of Los Angeles.
<P>
Following the auction, <b>Bob Wilson</B>, a representative for the Lund Foundation, and <b>William Lund</B>, who was accompanied by his 27-year-old son, <B>Bradford</b>, met with Taupin. "It could not have gone to a better cause," Lund told Taupin. "My son is here because of the hospital and its doctors." Lund, who was married to the late <b>Sharon Disney Lund</b>, daughter of <b>Walt Disney</b>, is a longtime supporter of the hospital. (Lana Fanelli)

<b>Madonna</b> may be coming to a club near you.
<p>
That's right, the Material Girl is tossing around the idea of scheduling a few small club dates in the United States to promote her upcoming album, <I>Ray Of Light</I>, which is scheduled for a March 3 release. So far, the only "confirmed" date is an appearance at the <b>Roxy</b> in New York this Saturday. Although Madonna's spokeswoman at <b>Warner Bros.</b> could not confirm this show, a representative from the Roxy told <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> Wednesday that Madonna is in fact performing there Saturday night. Word has it that Madonna will sing three to five songs off her forthcoming album.
<p>
<a href="http://www.wbr.com/madonna" target="NEW">Madonna's official website</a> at Warner Bros. reports that Madonna will schedule a few club dates starting Feb. 14 (read: the Roxy show), however other than that, no other information is available.
<p>
In related news, starting Feb. 17, Madonna heads across the Atlantic to promote <I>Ray of Light</I> in Europe. She will make stops in Germany, France, England and Italy to perform live on various variety shows in those countries. 
<P>
Stay tuned to <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> for more information. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 3 -->
For the next week, <b>Kristin Hersh</b> will offer fans a peak at her daily on-the-road diary entries.
<p>
Hersh, who spends the next week on a radio promotional tour, will send in daily reports to <a href="http://www.hipmama.com">Hip Mama</a>, a website designed for today's cool moms. These reports are a way for Hersh to stay in touch with other working mothers as well as fans, a source at <b>Rykodisc</b> told <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> on Thursday. Hersh's camp has been talking to Hip Mama, which is also a print magazine, for some time and realized this was a great way for Hersh to speak to her contemporaries. 
<p>
Hersh hits the road for a tour of the U.K. during the month of March and then tours the United States in April. She may continue to file daily reports to Hip Mama, but those details have not been smoothed out yet. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 4 -->
(NEW YORK) - <b>Comedy Central's</b> outrageous animated television program "South Park" has been on the air less than a year, but the break-away hit already has enough momentum to warrant an album.
<p>
According to sources, <b>Rick Rubin</b> is putting an album together for <b>Columbia</b> that is due in August. Although song selection is far from complete, expect the album to prominently feature <b>Isaac Hayes</b>, who is the voice of "South Park" character <b>Chef</b>.
