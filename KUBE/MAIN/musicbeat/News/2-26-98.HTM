<!-- Story 3 -->
The <i>Titanic</i> soundtrack is still barreling ahead with all engines full steam, but the top of the nation's music sales charts have some new blood, courtesy of southern gangsta rap and an '80s-based flick.
<P>
<i>Titanic</i>'s still No. 1 by a long shot, selling 562,000 copies for the week ending February 22, according to <b>SoundScan</b>. (That makes four million copies sold in just 11 weeks for the soundtrack; during <i>all</i> of 1997 just two records, <b>Jewel's</b> <i>Pieces of You</i> and the <b>Spice Girls'</b> <i>Spice</i>, sold more copies.)
<P>
But making a run at the top spot is rapper <b>Master P's</b> younger brother, New Orleans' own <b>Silkk the Shocker</b>. His <i>Charge It 2 Da Game</i> debuts at No. 3, selling 248,000 copies, while the soundtrack to <b>Adam Sandler's</b> <i>The Wedding Singer</i>, featuring the flashback sounds of <b>Culture Club, the Smiths, New Order</b> and <b>Musical Youth</b> (Class of '84, anyone?), bounds from No. 26 all the way to No. 9, selling 89,000 copies. 
<P>
The other noteworthy debut was singer/songwriter <b>Ani DiFranco's</b> <i>Little Plastic Castle</i>. Released on her own <b>Righteous Babe Records</b>, the record comes in at a lofty No. 22. For one week, at least, the indie babe from Buffalo, N.Y., managed to outsell mainstream pop diva <b>Mariah Carey</B>, whose <i>Butterfly</i> logged in at No. 24.
<P>
From the top it was <i>Titanic</i>, followed by <b>Celine Dion's</b> <i>Let's Talk About Love</i> (selling 288,000 copies); </i>Charge It 2 Da Game</i>; <i>Savage Garden</i> (105,000); <b>Pearl Jam's</b> <i>Yield</i> (102,000); <i>Backstreet Boys</i> (99,000); <b>Usher's</B> <i>My Way</i> (95,500); Spice Girls' <i>Spice World</i> (95,000); The Wedding Singer</i>; and <b>Matchbox 20's</b> <i>Yourself or Someone Like You</i> (87,000).
