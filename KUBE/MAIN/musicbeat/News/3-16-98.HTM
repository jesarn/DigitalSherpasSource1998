<b>G Love</b> treated fans to a <I>very</I> intimate surprise show at Chicago's <b>Blue Note</b> Thursday night.
<P>
The Philadelphia-based pop funk singer was in town to film an episode of the "Jenny Jones Show" with his <I>two</I> bands -- <b>Special Sauce</b> and the <b>All Fellas </b>. G Love told <b>JAM</B><font size=-1>TV</font> although they were on a day off from their current U.S. tour, they wanted to play a "special" show in Chicago. And special it was.
<P>
The nine-piece band -- which included two drummers, upright bass, guitars and percussion and doo-wop singers -- took the stage at the tiny venue (situated across the street from the <b>Double Door</b>, scene of the now infamous <B>Rolling Stones</b> Chicago club gig last fall) around 10:15 p.m. and played a nearly two-hour, funkified set for approximately 100 people.
<P>
After removing his baseball cap to reveal  tousled  locks of dark hair, G Love broke out his reggae-infused, R&B dance grooves, including "Take You There," "Small Fish" and "This Ain't Living," as well as a mellow blues cover of <b>ZZ Top's</B> "Jesus Just Left Chicago." The night culminated with G Love's latest single, "I-76."
<p>
After the show, G Love told us: "It was a great night playing with Special Sauce and All Fellas, and it's cool to watch the groove ride." (Ari Bendersky)
