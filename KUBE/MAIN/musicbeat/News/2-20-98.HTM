<!-- Story 3 -->
While fans in India eagerly await the arrival of the <b>Spice Girls</B>, at least one woman is trying to prevent the pop quintet from performing in a sacred temple there.
<p>
Producers for the Spice Girls' forthcoming world tour want to book the Fab Five to play a concert at the <b>Khajuraho Temples</B>, located in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. The temples are adorned with erotic sculptures and carvings, not unlike those in the 16th century Hindu text, the "Kamasutra".
<P>
<b>Geeta Chandron</b> a classical dancer, has publicly decried the Spice Girls performance saying they do not fit within the spiritual boundaries of Hinduism, the <I>Agence France Presse</I> reported. "The eroticism of Kahjuraho is part of the larger Hindu view of cyclicity [sic] of life. The Spice Girls should not be allowed to make these temples an erotic prop for their performances," Chandron told the <I>AFP</I>. Chandron has reportedly received support from many other Indian artists. (Ari Bendersky)

<p>
The first PE set will reunite the hip-hop heroes with their original producers, the <b>Bomb Squad -- Hank
Shocklee, Terminator X</b> and <b>Gary G-Wiz</b>, among others. The disc, which PE founder <b>Chuck D.</b> describes as "a mixture of <b>Redman</b> meets <b>Rage Against The Machine</b>," is slated to street in late '98. 
<P>
In addition, Public Enemy will provide the soundtrack to <b>Spike Lee's</b> forthcoming film <I>He Got Game</I>. "We're the first rap group to record music for an entire soundtrack, not just one song," says Chuck D, recalling the days when artists like <b>Isaac Hayes</b> scored a whole film.
