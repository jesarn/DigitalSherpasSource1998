(NEW YORK) - <b>Jon Bon Jovi, Toni Braxton, Hanson</b> and the <b>Backstreet Boys</b> were among the 24 winners Thursday at the <b>Echo Awards</b>, the German equivalent of the Grammy Awards. 
<P>

<!-- Story 3 -->
(NEW YORK) - Under the wing of new management -- her mom -- <b>Jewel</b> is forging ahead with a slew of projects, including her film debut. 
<p>
The <b>Atlantic</B> artist has dropped manager <b>Inga Vainshtein</B> and will now be represented solely by her mother, <b>Nedra Carroll</b>. The San Diego-based Carroll has no prior management experience. She says the shooting of Jewel's first film may push back the release of her next album, planned for late October or early November. Jewel has not yet chosen a producer or begun recording the set.
<P>
The singer/songwriter is currently in Kansas shooting her leading role in the Civil War epic <I>To Live On</I>, directed by <b>Ang Lee</b> (<I>The Ice Storm</I>), which should open in December or early next year. Meanwhile, her <b>HarperCollins</B> poetry book is due at the end of May, and her "scrapbook" will likely come shortly after the album is released.

<!-- Story 3 -->
<B>Aimee Osbourne</B>, the teenaged daughter of rocker <B>Ozzy Osbourne</B>, was the highest bidder at <B>Christie's City of Hope</B> celebrity auction on Thursday evening for a day with the teen pop stars <B>Hanson</B>, a prize that commanded $16,000.
<P>
More than 250 bidders joined Ms. Osbourne at the standing-room only event at Christie's in Los Angeles.   The <B>Ozzman's</B> daughter, who claims she really bought the concert tickets and backstage pass for her 13-year old sister, left the auction with one of the most expensive gifts of the evening.  
<P>
One bidder paid $16,000 for a dinner for 10 prepared by <b>Wolfgang Puck</B> and another walked off with a $12,000 basketball duel with the L.A. Laker Shaquille O'Neal</B>.  Lunch with supermodel <B>Cindy Crawford</B> went for $7,500, while the most expensive prize of the night -- a week as editor of <I>HITS</I> magazine -- was purchased for $20,000 by <B>Norman J. Pattiz</B>, chairman of <B>Westwood One Inc.</B>.
<P>
All in all, more than $131,000 was raised for City of Hope.
<p>
In the last 25 years, the City of Hope Music and Entertainment Industry has raised more than $28 million to benefit victims of cancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and other fatal diseases.   This one-time event was made possible by artists who wished to support the City of Hope's crusade, and according to the head auctioneer at Christie's, helped raise more money than expected.
