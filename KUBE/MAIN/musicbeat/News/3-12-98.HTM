<!-- Story 3 -->
(NEW YORK) - <b>Ray Charles</b> will make his first solo performance in 53 years this weekend on television shopping network <b>QVC</b> to promote the first product from his merchandising and marketing company <b>RCR Productions</B>, a book-and-CD set called <I>Ray Charles My Early Years 1930-1960</I>. 
<P>
Charles will be selling the package during a 15-minute segment of QVC on Saturday at 4 p.m. Accompanying himself on piano, he will perform one of the songs on the recording, which includes such hits as "Georgia On My Mind," "Hit The Road Jack," and "I Can't Stop Loving You."

<P>
It will also be promoted on QVC after the telecast. The book and CD are priced at $25.97. Charles told QVC he conceived the project as a book, then "added the music to complement the reading."

Although the doors to <b>Experience Music Project</b> -- Seattle's new 130,000-square-foot interactive rock 'n' roll museum -- won't open until 1999, music fans can get a preview at EMP's award-winning website.
<P>
A trip to <a href="www.experience.org">www.experience.org</a> provides a history of the Seattle sound, an evolution of the guitar, the history of the electric bass and a look inside the genius of <B>Jimi Hendrix</B>.
<P>
Conceptualized by multimedia guru <B>Paul G. Allen</B>, the EMP museum will house more than 70,000 musical artifacts, a number that museum spokesman <B>Jason J. Hunke</B> says will double by the time the doors open. 
<P>
Originally designed to house Allen's Hendrix memorabilia, EMP will be a virtual archive that chronicles music's creative process, Hunke said.  He also explains that certain exhibit name plates will be interactive, allowing visitors access to the EMP database for a more in-depth lesson on the displays. Labs, or "sound pods," will allow musicians to record and produce music during their visit while the in-house, 200-seat auditorium will be used for intimate performances, and lectures as a part of EMP's educational program, which officially gets underway this summer.
<P>
<B>Experience Arts Camp</B> will take place from July 20 to 31 and will offer 80 children between the ages of 8 and 12 the opportunity to study under experienced artists in the areas of visual art, music, dance and theater.  
<P>
Hunke says the site will remain active even after the museum opens, and will grow to include dozens of technological treats as the grand opening of the museum inches closer. (Lana Fanelli)

<!-- Story 3 -->
Enjoying her biggest sales week of the '90s, <b>Madonna</b> roars back up the charts with her new album, <i>Ray of Light</i>, selling 371,000 copies for the week ending March 8, according to <b>SoundScan</b>. 
<P>
That nearly triples what her last album, the <i>Evita</i> soundtrack, sold its first week in stores. 
<p>
Unfortunately for the Material Girl, the critically acclaimed <i>Ray of Light</i> was blocked from the No. 1 spot by the still-mighty <i>Titanic</i> soundtrack. That fits a frustrating pattern for Madonna, with all her '90s albums (<i>Erotica</i>, <i>Bedtime Stories</i> and <i>Evita</i>) coming <i>this</i> close to No. 1, but never landing the coveted spot. Perhaps <i>Ray of Light</i> will end the drought. 
<p>
The other big top ten news came in the form of gangsta rapper <b>Scarface</b>, whose <i>My Homies</i> debuts at No. 4. 
<p>
From the top, it was <i>Titanic</i> (selling 476,000 copies) followed by <i>Ray of Light</i>; <b>Celine Dion's</B> <i>Let's Talk About Love</i> (224,000); <i>My Homies</i>; <i>Savage Garden</i> (107,000); <b>Silkk the Shock's</b> <i>Charge It 2 Da Game</i> (105,000); <b>K-Ci & Jo Jo's</b> <i>Love Always</i> (100,000); <i>Backstreet Boys</i> (98,000); the soundtrack to <i>the Wedding Singer</i> (93,000); and <b>Usher's</B> <i>My Way</i> (90,000). 
<p>
Meanwhile, <b>Garth Brooks</b> continues his yo-yo chart act. A few weeks back, after appearing on the highly rated "Oprah Winfrey Show," Brooks' three month-old <i>Sevens</i> jumped from No. 24 to No. 4, but then began to drop again. This week he's back up, from No. 22 to No. 12. The fuel this time? His recent <b>NBC</B> concert special and his "Saturday Night Live" hosting duties. If he could just get his own weekly show, than maybe <i>Sevens</i> would stay in the top 10 for good.
<p>
Elsewhere, sales of the <b>Artist's</b> <i>Crystal Ball</i> are growing, jumping from No. 141 to No. 62. That's noteworthy because <i>Crystal Ball</i> is the four-disc set that the Artist, trying to do an end-run around major record companies, first tried to sell by a 1-800 number and on the Internet. When that didn't pan out he announced a deal with the Best Buy chain to sell the record exclusively (again without a major label backer). Fact is, fans can find <i>Crystal Ball</i> in lots of stores besides Best Buy. But the Artists' approach remains a novel one, and for now it seems to be working.
