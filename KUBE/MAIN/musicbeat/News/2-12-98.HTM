<b>Madonna</b> may be coming to a club near you.
<p>
That's right, the Material Girl is tossing around the idea of scheduling a few small club dates in the United States to promote her upcoming album, <I>Ray Of Light</I>, which is scheduled for a March 3 release. So far, the only "confirmed" date is an appearance at the <b>Roxy</b> in New York this Saturday. Although Madonna's spokeswoman at <b>Warner Bros.</b> could not confirm this show, a representative from the Roxy told <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> Wednesday that Madonna is in fact performing there Saturday night. Word has it that Madonna will sing three to five songs off her forthcoming album.
<p>
<a href="http://www.wbr.com/madonna" target="NEW">Madonna's official website</a> at Warner Bros. reports that Madonna will schedule a few club dates starting Feb. 14 (read: the Roxy show), however other than that, no other information is available.
<p>
In related news, starting Feb. 17, Madonna heads across the Atlantic to promote <I>Ray of Light</I> in Europe. She will make stops in Germany, France, England and Italy to perform live on various variety shows in those countries. 
<P>
Stay tuned to <b>JAM</b><font size=-1>TV</font> for more information. (Ari Bendersky)
