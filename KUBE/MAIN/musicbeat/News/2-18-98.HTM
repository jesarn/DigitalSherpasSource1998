<!-- Story 3 -->
Thirteen years after "We Are The World" helped raise millions of dollars for Ethiopian famine relief, <b>Michael Jackson</b> wants to use the name for a benefit concert in South Korea.
<p>
Tentatively titled "We Are The World 2," Jackson's concert would take place on Oct. 10 at the <b>Olympic Stadium</B> in Seoul. Money raised from the event will be earmarked for the starving children of North Korea, the <I>L.A. Times</I> reported. 
<p>
<b>Luciano Pavarotti, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion</b> and <b>Boyz II Men</b> will be invited to perform, according to the <I>Times</I>. Jackson also wishes to obtain taped messages to air during the event from world dignitaries such as <b>Nelson Mandela</b> and <b>Pope John Paul II</B>, conveying their words of hope and peace.
<p>
The concert, however, is in its planning stages and has not yet been absolutely confirmed. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 3 -->
(NEW YORK) - <b>Rupert Perry</b>, president/CEO of <b>EMI Europe</b>, publicly apologized recently for the incident at last week's <b>Brit Awards</b>, in which <b>Chumbawamba</b> drummer <b>Danbert Nobacon</b> dumped a bucket of ice water on U.K. <b>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott</b>. 
<p>
Describing the dousing as "a personal political protest," Perry added, "No music company can control the political views of its artists, but we wish to sincerely apologize to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mrs. Prescott, and the other guests for the anguish caused." 
<p>
The BPI also apologized, saying the incident was "offensive and unacceptable." Chumbawamba is signed to the EMI Group outside North America via a deal with EMI Germany. No apology for the dousing has come from Chumbawamba, currently on tour in Japan; its management, <b>Doug Smith Associates</b>, declined to comment. 
<p>
The band, which admitted the incident was a publicity stunt, attempted to justify it nonetheless. In a recent statement the group claimed: "If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events such as the Brit Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.
