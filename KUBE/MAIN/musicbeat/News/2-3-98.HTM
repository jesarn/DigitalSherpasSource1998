<!-- Story 3 -->
The first set of shows for the upcoming <B>Spice Girls</b> world tour went on sale over the weekend and sold out in less than two hours.
<p>
Critics may be saying the Spice Girls time is coming due, but fans obviously don't agree. Tickets for the Feb. 24 and 25 shows, which kick off the Fab Five's European tour, went on sale shortly after being announced on live radio and were snatched up in no time. 
<p>
The show will take place at the <b>Point Theatre</B>, a converted railway warehouse along the banks of the River Liffey, where the <b>Eurovision Song Contest</B> is often held.
<P>
The world tour kicks off at the end of the month and sees the Royal Spicy Ones hitting arenas and stadiums in countries including Spain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Norway and of course, the United Kingdom. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 2 -->
Singer <b>Bobby Brown</b>, who first got his start with <b>New Edition</b> back in the '80s, was convicted in a DUI case on Thursday in a Florida courtroom.
<p>
Brown, 30, was finally brought to trial following an incident in 1996 when he crashed his black Porsche into bushes and a street sign in Hollywood, Fla. When the judge read Brown's sentence, the singer reportedly broke down and started crying. His wife, <b>Whitney Houston</b>, was said to be crying as well.
<P>
After the crash, Brown's blood alcohol level was tested at 0.2 percent, more than twice Florida's legal limit, according to legal testimony. Drugs were also discovered in his blood. Further, Brown broke four ribs and a foot in the crash, testimony showed. 
<p>
Brown was ordered to spend five days in jail and undergo drug and alcohol treatment. His attorney, <b>Robert Buonauro</b>, questioned why it took four months to charge Brown with drunk driving and, after posting a $15,000 bond to keep Brown out of jail, said he would appeal the case, according to the <I>Associated Press</I>.

<!-- Story 1 -->
(NASHVILLE) - <b>311</b> will continue a series of international <b>WARPED Tour</b> concert dates despite the temporary loss of drummer <b>Chad Sexton</b>, who fractured his left wrist on a Jan. 17 tour stop in Sydney, Australia. 
<P>
The incident occurred during a casual pickup game of American-style football at the beginning of a series of WARPED dates in the Pacific. During Sexton's absence, 311 is relying on <b>Yeti</b>, the band's much-beloved drum tech, to fill in on three songs, and <b>Josh Freese</b> of <b>The Vandals</b> to play the rest of the set. 
<p>
Sexton is expected to return in about a month.
