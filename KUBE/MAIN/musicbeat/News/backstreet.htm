<H2>Teenagers go gaga over U.S. pop idols</H2>

&#160; About 3,000 screaming, teary-eyed girls mobbed the MuchMusic building last night to catch one more glimpse of the Backstreet Boys during a live concert broadcast.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Mounted police officers and metal barricades contained the frenzied crowd at the corner of Queen and John Sts.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160; Many of the young, hysterical fans had waited in sub-zero temperatures since 4 a.m. yesterday to see their heroes during a 90-minute concert broadcast from coast to coast.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Eight people - most of them injured in the swaying crowd, including one person with an injured leg - were transported to downtown hospitals and another eight were treated on site, said an ambulance spokesman.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;But MuchMusic Vice President Denise Donlon said all of the injuries were minor.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;"They were just people getting worked up ... a lot of young raging hormones," she said.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;<B> CONCERT SOLD OUT</B>
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;The performance by the Florida band, one day after a sold-out concert for 27,000 at the SkyDome, was a big hit with the young fans.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;"I'm so happy," shouted Marina Gromova, 13, as tears streamed down her face.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Stephanie Aguar, 14, of Toronto, braved the cold for hours before the 7:30 p.m. concert on the MuchMusic stage because "we love them. We just want a glimpse, just to touch one of them."
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Some girls had lined up as early as 4 a.m. to scream, cry and possibly touch Howie D., A.J., Brian, Kevin or Nick.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;"I've been here since four this morning. I just love Howie," said Gulshan Vazir, 13.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Chants of "Backstreet Boys!" and "We want Backstreet!" were endless throughout the day from the predominantly female, teenaged crowd.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;"They are a lot better than most things out there. They are pretty easy to listen to," said Jennifer Magilsen of Caledon.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Magilsen brought her daughter, who was celebrating her 12th birthday, to try to catch a glimpse of the Backstreet Boys.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;MuchMusic owner Moses Znaimer was thrilled with the show.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;"They're terrific. They are really quite exceptional," Znaimer said, adding that the hyper crowd was this generation's version of Beatlemania.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;MuchMusic used a large screen in the parking lot to help fans sneak a peek at the band, but the crowd thronged around the front windows of the music station to get a glimpse of their musical heroes.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Queen St. was closed off from John St. to Beverley St. beginning at noon as the crowds began to swell. Police Staff-Sgt. John Sillaots said 18 paid-duty officers were assigned to control the crowds.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;<B> PULLED TO SAFETY</B>
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Concern for the safety of the fans was evident earlier in the afternoon.
<BR>&#160;<BR>&#160;Security personnel were constantly telling the young crowd to step back from the barricades, so no one would get hurt. Young girls had to be pulled out from the front rows because they were being crushed, a full four hours before the show began.
