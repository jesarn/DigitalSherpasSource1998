<!-- Story 1 -->
The next few months are going to be extremely busy for Madonna. 
<br><br>
First, the controversial pop star is set to release a new album, Ray of Light, on Warner Bros. Records on March 3. Co-written with Patrick Leonard and William Orbit, Ray of Light features the single "Frozen," which will hit radio next month. 
<br><br>
In addition to the album, Madonna has two film projects in the works. Director Mattia Karel's The Red Door, which will enter production this summer, features the Material Girl in the role of a woman who was abused as a child but overcomes her past to reunite with an estranged brother who is dying of AIDS. Details about her other film, Recycle Hazel, are still sketchy, but it is known that Madonna will both co-produce and star in the project. (Seth Hindin)

Yield, the much-anticipated new Pearl Jam album, hits record stores in a week. 
<br><br>
Many radio stations across North America have already starting giving away advance copies of Yield, creating quite a buzz among fans. Those who can't get their hands on the album prior to the Feb. 3 release date can tune in to the upcoming Monkey Wrench Radio Show (Self Pollution Radio 2). On Jan. 31, Pearl Jam will take over the airwaves and broadcast live on radio stations across North America. The band's camp says that Monkey Wrench will "officially" run for two hours, but "knowing Pearl Jam, it could run as long as four hours." 
<br><br>
Eddie Vedder and Stone Gossard will also get intimate with Canadian fans on Jan. 27 during a live radio show there. The program will start at 6 p.m. (EST) and run for an hour and a half, during which time Eddie and Stone will talk about the making of Yield, as well as their plans for 1998. Canadian fans can tune into Q107 (107.1) and The EDGE (102.1) in Toronto to catch it. 
<br><br>
In related news, Pearl Jam's Rumor Pit confirms that the band plans to tour the United States and Canada starting in June. Check back with JAMTV in the near future to catch those dates. 
<br><br>
Pearl Jam kicks off the Pacific leg of their tour Feb. 20 in Maui, Hawaii, then they head to Australia and New Zealand. Their original schedule didn't include a stop in Perth, Australia, but following an immense drive from fans (12,000 people signed a petition), the band added a stop, which should be announced soon.

(LOS ANGELES) - James Brown was released Wednesday from a hospital where he had been treated for an addiction to painkillers. 
Brown, 64, was admitted to a Columbia, S.C., hospital Jan. 15. The "godfather of soul" began taking painkillers after hurting his back while doing a split during a recent show in Florida, his attorney said. "Everybody's making a big deal out of nothing. He's fine," said his agent.

<!-- Story 4 -->
The Spice Girls' premiere of their movie Spiceworld in Los Angeles prompted a slew of Hollywood notables to get a little spicy themselves. 
<br><br>
In celebration of the Spice Girls arrival in Tinsel Town, TV Guide asked a bunch of celebrities what their nickname would be if they could join the Spice Girls. Kathy Griffin, Suddenly Susan's feisty redhead, said, "I would be Hooker Spice, 'cause I'm dressed like that anyway." Wearing a gold lamé outfit, Griffin continued by saying "I'm not, like, dressed too slutty tonight, but I'm a little slutty."
<br><br>
<i>Friends</i> star Matthew Perry commented that he'd like for the Fab Five to go away by calling himself "No More Spice Girls Spice." Mitch Pileggi of the X-Files concurred with Perry by naming himself "Loser Spice" based on the fact he'd kill himself. 
<br><br>
Jenna Elfman star of Dharma & Greg, for whatever reason, said she'd be "Hot Banana Spice," while Drew Carey said he'd be "Old Spice," then followed with a joke that was apparently too saucy for print. (Ari Bendersky)
