<b>Carl Wilson</b>, a founding member of the <b>Beach Boys</b>, succumbed to lung cancer on Friday evening. 
<p>
Wilson, 51, was battling the disease for about a year and died with his family by his side. Although he was diagnosed with cancer last year and underwent chemotherapy, Wilson insisted on being a part of the Beach Boys tour last summer. 
<p>
During the Beach Boys' legendary career, the California surf group influenced countless musicians and released such hits as "California Girls," "Help Me, Rhonda," Good Vibrations" and "Wouldn't It Be Nice."
<p>
Their first single, "Surfin' Safari," was released in 1962 and was followed by the successful "Surfin' USA" in 1963. They reached superstar status after the release of "Good Vibrations" in 1967 and their seminal album, <I>Pet Sounds</I>, is ranked as one of the most influential albums of all time. (Ari Bendersky)

The <b>Tuff Gong</b> just got tougher with 28 previously unreleased <b>Bob Marley</b> tracks headed your way.
<p>
The forthcoming box set, <I>The Complete Wailers 1967 - 1972 Part I</I> (<b>JAD Records</b>), highlights songs from a time when the groundbreaking reggae group was virtually unknown outside of Jamaica. The 3-CD set culls songs that have been digitally preserved over time, with no alterations or enhancements whatsoever.
<p>
Many of the songs were originally recorded as 7-inch singles meant for release in Jamaica only. Also, when first printed, only 100 copies or less of many of the songs were issued, making these tracks some of the most sought after Marley songs to date. In fact, only 26 copies of "Selassie Is The Chapel," a song included in the compilation, were originally printed.
<p>
"This box set is a musical journey representing a time in our lives when we were free to explore musical styles and lyrical content," said <b>Bunny Wailer</b>, the last living member of the original Wailers lineup. "Collectively, Bob, <b>Peter [Tosh], Rita [Marley]</b> and myself were creating a unique vision that would one day become the musical anthem for unity and freedom."
<p>
Longtime reggae enthusiasts <b>Roger Steffens</b> and <B>Bruno Blum</b> compiled the music for the box set and wrote extensive liner notes, which -- set within the context of the time of recording -- highlight this important and formative time for Marley and the Wailers.
<P>
"This project is a dream come true, containing the most sought after singles of Bob's career," Steffens and Blum said. "We estimate these discs contain more than $10,000 worth of collectors items -- if you could find them. It will change the way people understand Bob Marley and his multifaceted career forever."
