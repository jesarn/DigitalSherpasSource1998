<!-- Story 3 -->
(LOS ANGELES) - Rocker <b>Tommy Lee</b> was free on bail after pleading innocent to charges of abusing his wife, actress <b>Pamela Anderson Lee</b>, and their baby son. 
<P>
A judge reluctantly cut Lee's $1 million bail in half despite a plea relayed through an attorney Friday who said Mrs. Lee was fearful. Lee left with his lawyer. The prosecutor also alleged that Lee attacked his wife three times on the day she called 911 and each time she was holding their 7-week-old son Dylan. 
<p>
The child was endangered, said Deputy District Attorney <b>Katherine Solorzano</b>. She also said Lee kicked his wife, a former "Baywatch'' star, once in the back and once in the buttocks. It wasn't clear whether those were individual attacks or one attack. Ms. Solorzano said Mrs. Lee had no broken bones but sought medical treatment. 
<p>
As condition of bail, Lee was ordered to enroll in an anger-management class, surrender his passport, stay in Los Angeles County and abstain from alcohol and drug use. He was also ordered to stay at least 100 yards away from his wife, children and Mrs. Lee's parents.
