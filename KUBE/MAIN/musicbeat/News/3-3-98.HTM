<!-- Story 3 -->
In the current issue of <I>Elle</I> magazine, <b>Madonna</B> gives <b>Monica Lewinsky</b> some powerful advice: "Shut up and get a life."
<p>
The Material Girl, who released her most recent album, <I>Ray of Light</I>, yesterday, says that what two people share should be kept between them and not blabbed all over the place. "Monica Lewinsky should get a life. If you have an intimate relationship with somebody -- I don't care if it's the bell-boy or the President of the United States -- shut the f--- up," Madonna said. 
<p>
Madonna goes on to say that if the two did in fact have an affair, she doesn't care. "I don't think it makes him a bad president if it did happen anyway." 
<p>
The new mother also talks about quite nicely about the <b>Spice Girls</B>. "They're just running around having fun, wearing sexy clothes. I love them. I was a Spice Girl when I started out." (Ari Bendersky)

<b>Tommy Lee</b> will not contest divorce proceedings initiated by his wife, actress <b>Pamela Anderson</b>.
<P>
In a statement released Monday, Lee said: "I am completely devoted to [my sons] Dylan and Brandon and it is extremely painful and upsetting for me to be cut off from them at this difficult time. Although the current situation is awful for all parties, I am anxiously awaiting the day when I can be with them again."
<p>
Last week, Lee was arrested after his wife called police saying Lee had attacked and beat her several times last Thursday. During each episode, Anderson feared for her infant son, whom she said she was holding when Lee attacked her. Lee was held on $1 million bail, which was reduced to $500,000 when he was released on bail after pleading innocent.
<p>
Lee, who is currently on probation for the alleged assault of a photographer outside Los Angeles' <b>Viper Room</b> nightclub in 1996 (Lee maintains his innocence), said he will comply with all rules set forth by the court. "My attorney <b>Charles English</B> has forbidden me to discuss with anyone the details and precise nature of the case. I'm asking everyone to please not judge me or the situation until you have heard all the facts." (Ari Bendersky)
