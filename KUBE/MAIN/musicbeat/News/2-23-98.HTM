<!-- Story 3 -->
(NEW YORK) - Producer <b>Nate Fox</b> has filed a lawsuit against rapper/actor <b>Master P's No Limit</b> imprint and its distributor, <b>Priority Records</b>, seeking royalties for the 10 songs Fox co-wrote and co-produced on Master P's 1991 set, <I>Ghetto's Tryin' To Kill Me</I>. 
<p>
Fox, who was to receive a producer's royalty and 50 percent of the publishing income from his co-written songs, took P, aka <b>Percy Miller</b>, to court in 1996 to receive the monies due to him through that time. 
<P>
<I>Ghetto's Tryin' To Kill Me</I>, which was reissued last year in the wake of P's success with his sets <I>Ghetto D</I> and <I>I'm 'Bout It</I>, entered <I>Billboard's</I> Top Pop Catalog chart at No. 1 the week of Nov. 22, 1997; it currently resides there at No. 35. 
<p>
Fox seeks to be awarded the additional monies generated by the reissue, as well as to restore his co-writing and production credits on the album, which were omitted in the reissue, according to the suit. No date has been set for the court case. However, Master P has hired erstwhile <b>O.J. Simpson</b> lawyer <b>Johnnie Cochran</b> to defend him against Fox's charges.

<!-- Story 3 -->
(NEW YORK) - Fifteen years after her debut, is <b>Madonna</B> still relevant? 
<P>
The numerous radio and Internet leaks of "Frozen," the lead single from her forthcoming <b>Maverick/Warner Bros.</b> album, <I>Ray Of Light</I>, implies audiences think so. 
<P>
The set, slated for worldwide release March 3, shows the pop chameleon sewing intense words into edgy electronic backdrops and jagged guitar grooves. More than half of the disc's songs were written with <b>William Orbit</b>, a pioneering techno producer. "I've always found something melancholy about his music," Madonna says of Orbit. "Since I'm attracted to that sound, and since I tend to write a lot of
sad songs, we seemed like a good match." 
<P>
Orbit is equally pleased with the set's results, primarily because Madonna "insisted upon the purity of [his] arrangements, which worked astonishingly well with her pop songs."
