<!-- Story 3 -->
(HAMBURG) - <b>Michael Jackson</b> arrived in Munich on Saturday to provide moral support to concert promoter <b>Marcel Avram</b>, who starts a 3 1/2-year term for tax evasion in the city's Landsberg/Lech detention center April 1. 
<p>
"It is very painful for me to see my friend Marcel Avram being sent back to prison in spite of his age and the delicate state of his health," says Jackson, who has taken up residence with his entourage in Munich's <b>Bayerischer Hof</b> hotel. "As long as Marcel needs me, I will stay with him." 
<P>
It is Jackson's second trip to Munich to see Avram; he paid a surprise visit last May. During almost nine months in jail last year awaiting trial, Avram became seriously ill and underwent surgery for a
stomach ulcer and prostate trouble. He provided a full confession, paid the outstanding tax, and denied any criminal intent. 
<p>
The impresario was convicted Dec. 22 for withholding 5 million deutsch marks ($2.76 million) of tax after channeling fees to artists such as <b>Pink Floyd, Chris de Burgh</b> and <b>Joe Cocker</b> via a "letter-box" company in the Netherlands.

It's a classic tale of old meets new unfolding in the top ten this week, with rejuvenated veteran <b>Eric Clapton</b> and sparkling newcomer <b>Natalie Imbruglia</b> swooping in with hotshot performances for the week ending March 15, according to <b>SoundScan</b>.
 <p>
For Clapton, no stranger to the charts, <i>Pilgrim</i>'s debut at No. 4 (selling 168,258 copies) is his first top ten performance since 1994's <i>From the Cradle</i>, which entered at No. 1. But the real surprise this week is actress turned pop star Imbruglia, who comes to these shores from Australia by way of London. Her <i>Left of the Middle</i> enters the fray at No. 10, selling 84,257 copies. Of course, it'll be a difficult climb to the top with the slots one, two, and three holding steady with the indomitable <i>Titanic</i> soundtrack, <b>Madonna's</b> <i>Ray of Light</i> and <b>Celine Dion's</b> <i>Let's Talk About Love</i>, respectively.
 <p> 
Top down it was: <i>Titanic</i> (448,000 copies); <i>Ray of Light</i> (225,000); <i>Let's Talk About Love</i> (199,000); <i>Pilgrim</i>; <i>Savage Garden</i> (116,000); <b>K-Ci & Jo Jo's</b> <i>Love Always</i> (106,000); <i>the Wedding Singer</i> soundtrack (94,000); <i>Backstreet Boys</i> (90,000);
<b>Scarface's</b> <i>My Homies</i> (88,000) and <i>Left of the Middle</i>. 
 <p>
Elsewhere in the top 200, Grammy winners and nominees lost a step or two after their post-ceremony bumps, with artists like <b>Bob Dylan, Sarah McLachlan, Paula Cole</b> and <b>Erykah Badu</b> experiencing noticeable slides. Other noteworthy debuts included <b>Killah Priest's</b> <i>Heavy Mental</i>, which kicked in at No. 24, and the <b>Mavericks'</b> <i>Trampoline</i>, with a strong first showing at No. 97. Way down in the mid-hundreds, British techno duo <b>Mono</b> continued their measured climb through the ranks. Might want to keep an eye on that one ...

<b>G Love</b> treated fans to a <I>very</I> intimate surprise show at Chicago's <b>Blue Note</b> Thursday night.
<P>
The Philadelphia-based pop funk singer was in town to film an episode of the "Jenny Jones Show" with his <I>two</I> bands -- <b>Special Sauce</b> and the <b>All Fellas </b>. G Love told <b>JAM</B><font size=-1>TV</font> although they were on a day off from their current U.S. tour, they wanted to play a "special" show in Chicago. And special it was.
<P>
The nine-piece band -- which included two drummers, upright bass, guitars and percussion and doo-wop singers -- took the stage at the tiny venue (situated across the street from the <b>Double Door</b>, scene of the now infamous <B>Rolling Stones</b> Chicago club gig last fall) around 10:15 p.m. and played a nearly two-hour, funkified set for approximately 100 people.
<P>
After removing his baseball cap to reveal  tousled  locks of dark hair, G Love broke out his reggae-infused, R&B dance grooves, including "Take You There," "Small Fish" and "This Ain't Living," as well as a mellow blues cover of <b>ZZ Top's</B> "Jesus Just Left Chicago." The night culminated with G Love's latest single, "I-76."
<p>
After the show, G Love told us: "It was a great night playing with Special Sauce and All Fellas, and it's cool to watch the groove ride." (Ari Bendersky)

(NEW YORK) - Though he would not give any details, <b>EMI-Capitol Entertainment Properties</b> president <b>Bruce Kirkland</b> says that there will be new material next year from the <b>Beatles</b>.
<p>
"EMI-Capitol and <b>Apple Corp.</b> will release new songs from the Beatles," reveals Kirkland. "Expect 1999 to be another milestone year for the Beatles." He adds that in anticipation of the end of the 20th century, EMI-Capitol will market the Beatles as "The Band of the Millennium." 
<p>
"We're prepared for an intensified interest in the Beatles, and we want to re-promote this band to a new audience," says Kirkland. Capitol/Apple's three-volume <I>Anthology</I> album series sold a combined 6,180,000 copies in the U.S., according to <b>SoundScan</b>.
