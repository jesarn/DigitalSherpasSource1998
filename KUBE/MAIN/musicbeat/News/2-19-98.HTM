(NEW YORK) - <B>Motown</b> marks its 40th anniversary this month with an interactive website and 2-CD collection of the imprint's greatest hits. 
<p>
Launched earlier this week, <a href="http://www.Motown40.com">www.Motown40.com</a> serves as a digital archive of Motown Records, offering surfers a comprehensive timeline and discography of the label, which has at one time or another counted the <b>Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, Rick James, the Jackson 5, Boyz II Men, Queen Latifah</b>, and other R&B greats on its roster. 
<P>
Photos and biographies of Motown artists, as well as tour dates, news and release information about those currently recording for the label, are also posted. In addition to the print matter, the site also features a RealAudio jukebox that allows users to sample tracks from the <I>Motown 40 Forever</I> boxed set. 
<p>
Also released earlier this week, the compilation features songs from -- what else? -- the label's lauded  output. Among the pop and soul classics included are <b>Martha Reeves & the Vandellas'</B> "(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave," the <b>Four Tops'</b> "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)," the <b>Jackson 5's</b> "I'll Be There," and <b>Smokey Robinson and the Miracles'</b> "Tears Of A Clown."

(NEW YORK) - <b>Public Enemy</b> is working on two albums, both of which are scheduled for release this year. 
<p>
The first PE set will reunite the hip-hop heroes with their original producers, the <b>Bomb Squad -- Hank
Shocklee, Terminator X</b> and <b>Gary G-Wiz</b>, among others. The disc, which PE founder <b>Chuck D.</b> describes as "a mixture of <b>Redman</b> meets <b>Rage Against The Machine</b>," is slated to street in late '98. 
<P>
In addition, Public Enemy will provide the soundtrack to <b>Spike Lee's</b> forthcoming film <I>He Got Game</I>. "We're the first rap group to record music for an entire soundtrack, not just one song," says Chuck D, recalling the days when artists like <b>Isaac Hayes</b> scored a whole film. 
<p>
<I>He Got Game</I> is scheduled for a May 1 release by <b>Touchstone Pictures</b>; the soundtrack is still in label negotiations.

<!-- Story 3 -->
<I>Showbusiness!</I>, a live, two-CD set first released by <b>Chumbawamba</b> in 1995, is now available exclusively in the United States.
<P>
The first disc of the limited-edition collection features a live set by the Leeds, England-based pop anarchy outfit and includes older songs like "Anarchist," "Homophobia," "Nazi" and "Slag Aid." (Sorry folks, no "Tubthumping" on this one.) The second disc finds noted American commentator <b>Noam Chomsky</b> sharing his own anarchist views.
<p>
There are reportedly only about 500 copies of the set left, according to a news report posted at <a href="www.chumba.com">www.chumba.com</a>.

<!-- Story 3 -->
Lyrics to an unpublished <b>Jimi Hendrix</B> song penned in 1969 fetched &#163;17,250 (approximately US$28,000) in an auction  in London on Tuesday.
<p>
The untitled, three-page song was written while Hendrix was on a United Airlines flight en route to Los Angeles the year before the legendary guitarist died, according to the British <I>Press Association</I>.
<p>
The lyrics, which were part of a sale of rock memorabilia at <b>Bonhams</b> auction house, were purchased by a private buyer. Initial estimates put the lyrics' value between &#163;15,000 and &#163;20,000 (approximately US$24,000 to US$33,000). (Ari Bendersky)
