<!-- Story 4 -->
<b>Danbert Nobacon</B>, lead singer of <b>Chumbawamba</b>, was arrested Monday night after dumping a bucket of ice water on British <b>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott</b> at the <b>Brit Awards</b>.
<P>
The singer for the anarchist pop group who made it big in 1997 with their hit single "Tubthumping" was taken away by guards from the award ceremony at <b>Dockland Arena</b> in London. Prior to his arrest, Nobacon  leapt upon the table where Prescott and his family were watching <B>Fleetwood Mac</B> perform and dumped the water over his head.
<P>
Prescott's office released a statement Tuesday morning calling Nobacon's actions "deplorable and unacceptable public behavior." The statement continued: "It now appears that it was a publicity stunt designed to draw attention to the group's act. [Prescott] thinks it's utterly contemptible that his wife and other womenfolk should have been subjected to such cowardly, terrifying behaviour simply because they were accompanying a public figure at an event designed to support the British music industry." 
<p>
Although Nobacon was taken into custody by Scotland Yard, no charges were pressed in the matter and he was later released. (Ari Bendersky)
