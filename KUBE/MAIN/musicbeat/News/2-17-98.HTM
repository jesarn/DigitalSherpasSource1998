<!-- Story 3 -->
If you thought the Oscar and Felix tandem was odd, then the combination of hip-hop aristocrat <b>Coolio</B> and aging country & western star <b>Kenny Rogers</b> will seem downright abnormal.
<P>
Nonetheless, the rapper and the roper have teamed to re-record Rogers' famed "The Gambler." According to the song's producer, <b>Devon Davis</b>, Rogers will sing the hook and lead on the song, while Coolio will handle most of the verse duties. Davis has already laid down the backing track in a Los Angeles studio, which he calls "slamming." 
<P>
"It's better than 'Gangsta's Paradise,'" he adds, comparing it to Coolio's biggest hit. "It's off the hook, it's tight." Davis says it was primarily his idea to re-record the song. "I used to have a gambling problem," he admits. 
<P>
The song will initially be released as a single any time between late March and June, according to Davis, and later be included on a film soundtrack, Coolio's next album or Davis' debut, due out in June.
A music video for 'The Gambler '98', featuring Coolio and Rogers, is also in the works, and will be shot in Atlanta or Los Angeles.
<p> 
In related news, Coolio is close to ending his relationship with <b>Tommy Boy Records</B> and signing a new deal with a major label, reportedly <b>Maverick Records</B>. (Blair R. Fischer for <I>Rolling Stone Network</I>)
