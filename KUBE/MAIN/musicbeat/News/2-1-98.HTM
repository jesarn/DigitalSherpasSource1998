<!-- Story 2 -->
Singer <b>Bobby Brown</b>, who first got his start with <b>New Edition</b> back in the '80s, was convicted in a DUI case on Thursday in a Florida courtroom.
<p>
Brown, 30, was finally brought to trial following an incident in 1996 when he crashed his black Porsche into bushes and a street sign in Hollywood, Fla. When the judge read Brown's sentence, the singer reportedly broke down and started crying. His wife, <b>Whitney Houston</b>, was said to be crying as well.
<P>
After the crash, Brown's blood alcohol level was tested at 0.2 percent, more than twice Florida's legal limit, according to legal testimony. Drugs were also discovered in his blood. Further, Brown broke four ribs and a foot in the crash, testimony showed. 
<p>
Brown was ordered to spend five days in jail and undergo drug and alcohol treatment. His attorney, <b>Robert Buonauro</b>, questioned why it took four months to charge Brown with drunk driving and, after posting a $15,000 bond to keep Brown out of jail, said he would appeal the case, according to the <I>Associated Press</I>.
