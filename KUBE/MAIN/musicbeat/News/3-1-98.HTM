<!-- Story 3 -->
The storybook -- or is that straight-to-video? -- three-year marriage of <b>Pamela Anderson</b> and <b>Tommy Lee</b> is apparently over, as the <i>Baywatch</i> actress has filed for divorce after her drummer hubby allegedly beat her at their Malibu, Calif., home.
<P>
In a two-page petition that cites "irreconcilable differences" as grounds for divorce, Anderson (who has already dropped the "Lee"  from her name) also requested orders of protection covering her and the couple's two children, of whom she is seeking sole custody. The 35-year-old <b>Motley Crue</b> drummer, who was ordered held on $1 million bail after his arrest late Tuesday night, was granted a delay in his arraignment until his lawyer <b>Charles English</b> -- who is currently involved in a murder
case -- is available.
<P>
According to police reports, Pamela called 911 in hysterics, reporting that she had been attacked by her husband in their multimillion dollar Malibu mansion. Police dispatched to the scene reported that an anxious Anderson had sustained numerous welts to her back as well as an injury to one of her fingers, which was bloodied.
<P>
This isn't the first time the couple, who married just four days after meeting, have split: Anderson filed for divorce in November 1996, but reconsidered after Lee agreed to seek treatment for a drinking problem.
<P>
Prosecutors expanded the charges against Lee to include child abuse, since Anderson claims she was holding the couple's seven-week old son <b>Dylan</b> during the attack. Lee, who is on probation for assaulting a photographer outside Hollywood's <b>Viper Room</b> in 1996, could face up to 16 years in prison if convicted of all charges.
