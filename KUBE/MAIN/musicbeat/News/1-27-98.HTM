(LOS ANGELES) - James Brown was released Wednesday from a hospital where he had been treated for an addiction to painkillers. 
Brown, 64, was admitted to a Columbia, S.C., hospital Jan. 15. The "godfather of soul" began taking painkillers after hurting his back while doing a split during a recent show in Florida, his attorney said. "Everybody's making a big deal out of nothing. He's fine," said his agent.

<!-- Story 4 -->
The Spice Girls' premiere of their movie Spiceworld in Los Angeles prompted a slew of Hollywood notables to get a little spicy themselves. 
<br><br>
In celebration of the Spice Girls arrival in Tinsel Town, TV Guide asked a bunch of celebrities what their nickname would be if they could join the Spice Girls. Kathy Griffin, Suddenly Susan's feisty redhead, said, "I would be Hooker Spice, 'cause I'm dressed like that anyway." Wearing a gold lamé outfit, Griffin continued by saying "I'm not, like, dressed too slutty tonight, but I'm a little slutty."
<br><br>
<i>Friends</i> star Matthew Perry commented that he'd like for the Fab Five to go away by calling himself "No More Spice Girls Spice." Mitch Pileggi of the X-Files concurred with Perry by naming himself "Loser Spice" based on the fact he'd kill himself. 
<br><br>
Jenna Elfman star of Dharma & Greg, for whatever reason, said she'd be "Hot Banana Spice," while Drew Carey said he'd be "Old Spice," then followed with a joke that was apparently too saucy for print. (Ari Bendersky)

<!-- Story 5 -->
(NEW YORK) - An all-star concert for a slain police officer's family sold out its 1,435 tickets Saturday in "about an hour," according to Jerry Bakal, spokesman for FPI Concerts, the show's promoter. 
<br><br>
The Jon Bon Jovi and Friends Benefit Concert, scheduled for Jan. 31 at the Count Basie Theater in Red Bank, N.J., will feature such famous hometown heroes as Bon Jovi, Bruce Springsteen, Southside Johnny, Little Steven, Richie Sambora and Richie LaBamba, among others. 
<br><br>
The net proceeds from the $125-a-ticket show will benefit the family of Police Sgt. Patrick King, who was murdered with his own gun. "These musicians live around here, and know how [King's murder] shook up the community," says Bakal of the heavy-hitting lineup. "The Long Branch [N.J.] Police approached us about a benefit, and we sent letters to our clients. Jon [Bon Jovi] responded right away, as did others. There was no hesitation, even despite the circumstances."
