The winners have been chosen for the <b>1997 Online Music Awards</b>, and while some artists like <b>Spice Girls, Bush</b> and <b>Will Smith</B> celebrate the accolades, others like <b>Marilyn Manson, Mariah Carey</b> and <b>Kiss</b> may end up laughing their way up to the podium.
<P>
Since Feb. 1, more than 100,000 cyber-critics logged on to <B>AOL</B> to help determine the winners of this year's Online Music Awards.  Viewers were given the chance to cast their votes in 20 categories, some of which proved to be downright silly.
<P>
The <B>Spice Girls</B> walked away with an "Album of the Year" award, while <B>Baby Spice</B> was adorned as the cyber-world's "Favorite Spice Girl."  Voters took the liberty of awarding rock's Bad Boy, Marilyn Manson, with "Best Album for Torturing Your Parents" and "Artist Most Likely to be Damned to Hell."  
<P>
Chumbawamba will be remembered as "Favorite One-Hit Wonder" while Fresh Prince Will Smith took home "Favorite Guilty Pleasure" and "Best Male Singer."  Jewel beat <B>Mariah Carey</B> for "Best Female Singer," while Carey instead was honored as "Artist Most in Need of a Good Spanking."  <B>Bush's Gavin Rossdale</B> was tapped as "Pin-Up Artist of 1997," and his group was named "The Band Who Most Rocked Your World."  
<P>
Perhaps the most interesting results of this year's poll gave props to Notorious B.I.G. for "Flyest Hip-hop Artist Ever ... in 1997," Chemical Brothers for "Best Knob Twiddlers,"  <B>KISS</B> for  "Reunions We Never Thought We'd See In a Million Years (And Kind of Wish We Hadn't)" and comedian <b>David Spade</b> for "Dreamiest Hanson Brother."  (Lana Fanelli)

Taking their cue from the famous <b>YIPPIE</b> prank (attempting to levitate the Pentagon in 1968), a loose coalition of artists, entertainers, label and film company employees calling themselves the <b>Music Militia</b> has announced that they will levitate <b>Radio City Music Hall</b> on Wednesday night in protest of "mediocre corporate drivel" (presumably, <b>The Grammys</b>). 
<p>
According to a press release issued by the elusive <b>Transcendent Recordings</b>, thousands of Music Militia members will surround the venue at 6 p.m. engaging in an aural assault with horns, drums, voices and "noisemakers of all descriptions." The resulting ruckus will "liberate music from corporate accountants" and levitate Radio City Music Hall. 
<p>
After their unparalleled telekinetic feat, the Music Militia will reconvene at New York's <b>Coney Island High</b> for the <b>Anti-Grammy Awards</b>. The following Anti-Grammy winners have already been announced and, according to a venue spokesperson, will be performing at the event: Best Heavy Performance: <b>Candiria</b>; Best Rant/Spoken Word:  <b>Rev. Ivan Stang</b>; Best New Artist: <b>Osiva</b>; Lifetime Achievement Award: <b>John Hall (King Missile)</b>; Best Acoustic Performance: <b>Grass</b>. (Isaac Josephson)
