		For twelve pro seasons, whether as a starter or off the bench, Smooth has been a solid go-to man for the Mavs, the Lakers and the Supes.  In a Run-and-Gun offense, he has developed into a deep threat and last season was chosen for the NBA All-Star Three Point Shoot-Out.  Take a look at Big Smooth's Career.

Sam Perkins aka Big Smooth has an impressive resume: a NCAA Championship ring- size 16, an Olympic gold medal, and has missed the playoffs in only two out of his twelve NBA seasons.
Can you guess which team he was playing for?  Smooth played two years with Michael Jordan at North Carolina, and they together won the Championship in 1982.  That year, Sam was selected as a Second-Team All-American, and in 1984, was a First-Team selection.  

When the draft came about in 1984, Perkins was highly sought and the Dallas Mavericks chose him as the fourth overall pick.  That summer Sam and Michael Jordan teamed up to win gold on the U.S. Olympic Team.  As a rookie, Big Smooth made the NBA All-Rookie Team, with an average of 11 points and 7.4 rebounds per game.  He played in six seasons with the Mavericks, until he became a free agent in 1990 and signed with the Los Angeles Lakers.  In the 1991 NBA Finals against the Chicago Bulls, Perkins canned a last-second trey for the win, in the Lakers' only win of that series. 

Smooth was traded to the Seattle SuperSonics during the 1992-93 season, for Benoit Benjamin and the rights to unsigned rookie, Doug Christie. In his first full year with the Sonics, Perkins drilled all seven three-point attempts, tying a NBA record.  This last season he broke the record with an 8-for-8 preformance.
