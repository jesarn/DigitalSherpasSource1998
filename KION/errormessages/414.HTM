<h2>HTTP Error 414</h2>

<p><strong>414 Request-URI Too Long</strong></p>

<p>The server is refusing to service the request because the Request-URI is too long. This rare condition is likely to occur only in the following situations:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A client has improperly converted a POST request to a GET request with long query information.</p>

<p>A client has encountered a redirection problem (for example, a redirected URL prefix that points to a suffix of itself).</p>

<p>The server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit security holes present in some servers using fixed-length buffers for reading or manipulating the Request-URI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please contact the Web server's administrator if this problem persists.</p>
