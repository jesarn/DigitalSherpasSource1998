THE FINAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN TWA FLIGHT 800 AND AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLERS 
<P>
WAS PART OF A TAPE PLAYED FOR REPORTERS AT THE FAA HEADQUARTERS IN WASHINGTON. 
<P>
THE CONVERSATION WAS BRIEF AND BUSINESSLIKE, THE 747 WAS INSTRUCTED TO CLIMB TO 
<P>
15 THOUSAND FEET AND PILOT STEVEN SNYDER CONFIRMED THE COMMAND.  THE FAA PLAYED 
<P>
THE TAPE OF THAT EX

<P>
EXPLOSION. OTHER PILOTS MAKE SIMILAR REPORTS. 
<P>
SOUND HERE; 
<P>
FROM 31:57 TO 32:49

FOR NEARLY 3 MINUTES THE AIR CONTROLLER TRIES TO RAISE THE  CREW OF TWA

FLIGHT 800 WITHOUT SUCESS, PROMPTING AN UNITENDIFIED PILOT TO SUGGEST IT'S 
<P>
PROBABLY 800 THAT EXPLODED, AND ADDING THE POSTSCRIPT, GOD BLESS HIM.

MEANWHILE, A UNITED PILOT HEADED FOR LONDON CROSSES OVER THE SITE WHERE 
<P>
THE PLANE HAS CRASHED AND REPORTS ON WHAT HE'S SEEN. 
<P>
SOT #2 FROM EARLIER. 
<P>
THE FBI AND NTSB HAVE ALREADY STUDIED THE FAA TAPE AND TRANSCRIPT, AND 
<P>
HAVE FOUND NOTHING THAT MOVES THEM CLOSER TO DETERMINING WHAT CAUSED THE CRASH. 
<P>
YET, IN THIS INVESTIGATION THE RECORDED CONVERSATIONS ARE A REMINDER THAT THE 
<P>
CRASH IS MORE THAN A DIFFICULT SCIENTIFIC MYSTERY IT IS A HUMAN TRAGEDY AS

WELL.
