<TD  valign="top" width="370"><B>(AP)</B> 	  Virginia's governor, James S. Gilmore, made a troubling announcement this month when he reported that as many as one-third of would-be teachers in the state flunked a national test of basic reading, writing, and mathematics.
<BR>
<BR>	   But the news had even worse implications for the nation, since Virginia has the country's highest cutoff score for the Praxis I, a test used in 20 states to screen teacher college candidates and beginning teachers.
<BR>
<BR>Scarcely more than half the students who took the test nationwide would have made the Virginia cut.
<BR> 
<BR>	   <b>"Virginia students would be doing much better than the national average,"</b> said Charlotte Solomon, in charge of the Praxis examinations for the Educational Testing Service, a private company that supplies the tests to states. <b>"It begs the question of whether it's good enough."</b>
<BR>
<BR>	   Around the country, state education officials are asking whether tests of general knowledge and of specific subjects are rigorous enough to ensure that able people become teachers.
<BR> 
<BR>	   Some 35 states use Praxis I or more advanced tests in the Praxis series used to certify graduates for general knowledge, professional skills and subject knowledge. Some states have their own tests.
<BR>
<BR>	   Explanations vary on why scores are low, but poor pay tops the list. 
<BR>
<BR><b>"It clearly holds back who it is that's entering,"</b> said Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.
<BR>
<BR>		   In Pennsylvania, education officials are beginning to raise the bar for a number of tests. Among those being examined is a 120-question, general knowledge test for beginning teachers that covers social studies, math, literature and the arts, and science.
<BR>
<BR>	   <b>"We have a relatively high pass rate, but as we look at the exams and we look at the cut stores, we're not convinced that it is a meaningful exercise,"</b> said Michael Poliakoff, a deputy secretary of education. Nearly 91 percent of would-be teachers who took the general knowledge test last fall passed it.
<BR>
<BR>	   But most of the test-takers scored just about at the national average of 657 on a scale of 600-695. The state passing score is 644, close to that of several other states. And the highest cut score of any state is 649.
<BR>
<BR>	   Like other critics, Poliakoff says the national average would look good if the test were demanding. But people are asked to do such things as put World War I, the start of the Great Depression, and the Korean War in the right order.
<BR>
<BR>	   The testing service doesn't say that Praxis I results compare with those on an SAT, a widely given test for college admissions. Solomon says <B>"it's only partially true"</B> that Praxis is an easier test, insisting that the two exams focus on different abilities.
<BR>
<BR>	   But the standards often run afoul of the need to staff schools.
<BR>
<BR>	   North Carolina had to back off from higher standards several years ago. Mississippi is debating waivers for its cutoffs, and Florida has allowed waivers.
<BR>
<BR>	   Shortages also worry the same Virginians who advocate tough standards.
<BR>
<BR>	   <b>"You can begin to wonder what's going to happen down the road when more and more people turn away from preparing to teach,"</b> said Thomas A. Elliott, an assistant superintendent of education.</TD></TR><TR><TD NOWRAP  height="10"> </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="-2">Written by AP Education Writer Robert Greene. ©1998 The Associated Press.
