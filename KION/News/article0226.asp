<TD  valign="top" width="370"><B>(CBS)</B> <b>"Free speech not only lives. It rocks!"</b>
<BR>
<BR>With those words, an exuberant Oprah Winfrey met press and public on the steps of an Amarillo courthouse Thursday after she was found not liable for damages for a show about mad cow disease. Texas cattlemen said Winfrey's influence sank prices and cost them millions of dollars.
<BR>
<BR>The civil trial lasted for six weeks, and it took just six hours for jurors to reach a decision. During the trial, all parties had been under a court-imposed gag order, and by Thursday afternoon, Winfrey was ready to speak - about the right to free speech in America
<BR>
<BR><b>"I come from a people who have struggled and died to have a voice, and I will not be muzzled,"</b> Winfrey told reporters and a cheering crowd.
<BR>
<BR>After thanking her lawyers, the jury, the judge, and God, Winfrey told the crowd that a <b>"difficult and stressful time"</b> had left her <b>"a stronger person."</b>
<BR>
<BR>She added, <b>"I never considered settling, because I never thought I did anything wrong."</b>
<BR>
<BR>When the verdict was announced, courtroom observers say Winfrey put her hands over her face and appeared to weep. Then she hugged and shook hands with her attorneys.
<BR>
<BR>Spectators ran outside the courthouse to deliver the verdict. Cheers went up among the crowd outside.
<BR>
<BR>The cattlemen had sued her over an April 16, 1996, episode of <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i> that they said gave the false impression that American beef could spread mad cow disease to people.
<BR>
<BR>	   The lawsuit against the talk show host was expected to be the biggest test yet of the <b>"veggie libel"</b> laws enacted in Texas and 12 other states in recent years to protect agricultural products from false and disparaging remarks.
<BR>
<BR>	   But last week, in a big victory for Winfrey, U.S. District Judge Mary Lou Robinson ruled without explanation that the case could not go forward under the veggie libel law and would instead be tried as a conventional business defamation case.
<BR>
<BR>	   That meant the cattlemen had to meet a higher burden of proof: They had to show  Winfrey deliberately or recklessly hurt their business by way of false statements.
<BR>
<BR>The plaintiffs had sought more than $11 million in damages.</TD></TR><TR><TD NOWRAP  height="10"> </TD></TR><TR><TD><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="-2">©1998 CBS Worldwide Corp.
