Secretary General Kofi Annan's perspective, it appears his mission to Iraq has been a success. Annan's spokesman is saying that a deal with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein over U.N. weapons inspections has been struck, CBS News has learned.

<BR><table align="right" width="75"><tr><td><img src="http://kion.cbsnow.com/network/htdocs/sitg/images/sitg_bug.gif" width="75" height="76" border="0"></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><FONT size="-2" face="arial,helvetica" color="#3333cc"></FONT></b></td></tr></table>Spokesman Fred Eckhard told reporters that the deal falls within the U.N. Security Counsel's parameters for success. 
<BR>
<BR>The United States has not yet commented on the development.
<BR>
<BR>Reporting from Baghdad,<b>CBS News Correspondent Vicki Mabrey</b> says the deal probably means weapons inspectors will be allowed into eight disputed presidential sites, but diplomats from the five members of the Security Counsel would accompany them.
<BR>
<BR>Going into the talks, the major sticking point for U.N. officials was a 60-day time limit sought by Iraq. The U.N. Security Counsel had required full, unfettered access to the sites. A deal most likely means that issue has been resolved.
<BR>
<BR>On CBS News' <I>Face the Nation</I> this morning U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Bill Richardson, cautioned that <b>"the 60-day limit would be a serious problem."</b>
<BR>
<BR><b>"We want diplomacy to work,"</b> Richardson said. <b>"But. . .the United States feels that these are principles that Saddam Hussein has to comply with."</b>
<BR>
<BR>Annan continues to talk with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. Before entering that meeting, Annan said he felt he was close to a deal.
<BR>
<BR>	 During his stay in Baghdad, Annan has been in touch with a number of leaders including the representatives of the Security Council's five permanent members.
<BR>	
<BR>	   The United States has threatened a military attack against Iraq if Annan fails to persuade Saddam to open all sites without conditions. The U.S. military has deployed 25,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region.
<BR>
<BR>	   A government newspaper Sunday called the U.S. demand for unconditional access <b>"illogical and unrealistic,"</b> and said the best way out of the crisis is a compromise.
<BR>
<BR>	Other key developments in the Iraq crisis:
<BR><UL><LI>Iraq's parliament sent a memorandum on Sunday to members of the Security Council, urging them to prevent the United States from using force.
<BR>
<BR>	   <LI>The spokesman of the weapons inspection team, Alan Dacey, said experts for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons went out as usual to conduct their examinations of various non-controversial sites Sunday.
<BR><LI> The State Department, meanwhile, issued a warning to Americans in Iraq to <b>"depart as soon as possible."</b> The White House said the warning was routine and doesn't mean military action was imminent.</UL><BR><BR></TD>
