Women, as you may have noticed, are shaped differently than men. A fact
that seems to have been lost on most skate manufacturers.
<p>
Sure, lots of skates say they're specially made for women. But in actuality they're nothing more than men's skates shrunken down to approximate a women's size. 
<p>
And women, as you may also have noticed, are not shrunken men. 
<p>
Female feet, calves and ankles have a special physiology all their own. And that's why, ever since the beginning, we've built our womens' skates on a custom-designed women's
last, or foot mold, in half sizes. It's also why we've done extensive research on men's and women's foot structures and biomechanics. And why even our cuff designs are specially suited to men's and women's specific needs. 
<p>
What does that mean to you? The best fitting, most comfortable skate you can buy. Whether your hormone of choice is estrogen or testosterone.
