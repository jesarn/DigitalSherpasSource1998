<H2>K2 SoftBoot <br> 

The Mother Of All Skates</H2>

"I've got an idea. Let's make 

        one of those sloppy, 

 foot-pinching, hardshell skates 

            like everyone else!"

This, needless to say, was not the rallying cry around K2 when we
decided to get into the skate biz. What the world needed was not
another two-ton rolling ski boot engineered by Dr. Frankenstein. 
<p>
So we vowed we wouldn't do skates unless we could do them better than
everyone else. 
<P>
Long story short, we developed skating's first SoftBoot&#153;, launched it,
revolutionized the sport, and here we are today: the leader in skating
innovation. Why? Because our original SoftBoot&#153; design is still the most
comfortable and responsive available. Because we still spend nights, weekends and legal holidays working out new ways to make skates even better. 
<P>
And because, when we're not doing all that other stuff, we're out
skating. That makes all the other stuff worthwhile.
