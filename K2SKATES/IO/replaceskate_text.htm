Street/Vert Skating is an ever-emerging sport for people between the ages of 10 and 26.  In 1995, K2 created the Fatty, a skate designed by street skaters for street skaters.  We set the precedent for all street skates by lowering the lift in the entire skate by 4mm.  Lowering the lift allows skates to have a lower center of gravity on the skates, enabling them to execute their trick successfully.  Now most skate manufacturers have adopted this standard of production because the market demands it.  
<P>
Once again K2 listened to the needs of the market and is now producing an entire product line based around a replaceable skate.  Street skaters tend to wear out their skates by grinding curbs and rails, so K2 developed the Style Points series.  The <a href="../products/street-vert/stylebob/default.html" TARGET="_top">Style Points Bob</a> and <a href="../products/street-vert/king55/default.html" TARGET="_top">King 55</a> are fully equipped to remove every part on the skate.  
<P>
We have addressed every warranty issue the skaters reported from the Fatty and Backyard.  Now those warrantied parts will be available to replace at the skaters leisure instead of waiting 2-4 weeks for our warranty department to repair and return the skates.
