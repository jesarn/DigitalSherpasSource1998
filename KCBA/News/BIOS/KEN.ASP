<P>Ken realized his passion for sports at an early age, actually learning to read by looking over his fathers shoulder at the sports page of the newspaper. He  moved around quite a bit when he was a child, living in New Haven, Connecticut, New York and Los Angeles, California.  Constantly watching sports on television as a child, Ken feels he was almost led into becoming a TV sports anchor.  However, it was the college internships he participated in at several television stations that provided him with the experience necessary to pursue his dream career in television sports. Ken got his first break into professional TV while he was still in college.  His first day on the job at KMST-TV was less than two days after his college graduation!  After making the switch to weekend anchor for KCBA FOX News at Ten in 1992.  Soon, Ken's excellent work was rewarded with a promotion to main Sports Anchor for KCBA FOX News at Ten. Ken and his wife Keri and their daughter Kelsey live happily in Salinas, California with their Golden Retreiver, Shelby.</P>
